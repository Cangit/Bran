# Bran

Bran is my personal shell script for quickly setting up meteor projects
with my preferred configuration and packages.

Running (OSX executable) bran.command will install bran and set it up
with a global alias 'bran'. 
The following command will create a new meteor project inside the
current directory.

    bran NameOfNewProject
